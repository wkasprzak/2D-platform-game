# Object-oriented programming

Have you ever wondered how map overlays for Google Maps are created?  In the project you will build your own interactive visualization of a large dataset tagged by geospatial information.  Both powerful and challenging, data visualization is one of the hot topics of modern computer science - as well as something that influences our world every day!

To create this project, you’ll be working with a package called Unfolding Maps, which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations.  It was developed by Till Nagel and the team at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam along with other contributors and we are grateful that they developed such a cool package that we (and you) can build.

The project is separated into several parts, and you will be able to achieve project milestones. At the end of the course, you’ll have the opportunity to showcase your creation and see what your peers have built too.
