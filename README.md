# Object-oriented programming

</header>

Long term project in Java - Wojciech Kasprzak 155824<br>

Object-oriented programming project. The program is a platform game written in Java. The project comprises 30 classes organized into packages. The first package is named "entities," which includes classes necessary for generating, controlling, and defining the behavior of player character and opponents. The next package is "input", consisting of two classes for mouse and keyboard input. These classes are essential for the proper functioning of keyboard and mouse input in the application. <br>

The third package, "levels", contains classes used for building and controlling successive levels in the game. For testing purposes, three levels are added to the game, and their data is stored in CSV files. The main package serves as the primary package enabling the application's operation. It includes classes responsible for displaying the application window, as well as the main game class that controls, for example, the changing of displayed images. <br>

The following package contains classes for all physical objects available in the game, such as fish and spikes. The second-to-last package includes classes for all available game states, such as menu, help, options, etc. The last class, named "utils," includes a class containing information about enemies, the visual layer, and a class necessary for importing data into the application (levels, graphics). <br>

In the game, there are places designated for enabling and disabling music and special sound effects. However, I couldn't find suitable (free, with a license for any use, and in the appropriate format) resources, so the game currently does not include them. If I manage to find suitable resources, the game will include an additional audio package with classes that will enable the toggling of music and sound effects. <br>

The project includes many concepts related to object-oriented programming, such as: <br>
-> classes and objects <br>
-> access modifiers <br>
-> constructors <br>
-> getters and setters <br>
-> inheritance (e.g., classes entity and player) <br>
-> abstract classes (e.g., class entity, class enemy) <br>
-> interfaces (StateMethods) <br>

The project also utilizes object-oriented programming principles: <br>
-> encapsulation (e.g., using access modifiers like private and protected) <br>
-> data abstraction (objects provide a simplified, abstract version of their implementations) <br>
-> inheritance (as mentioned in the examples above) <br>
-> polymorphism (e.g., StateMethods interface for states in the whole game) <br>

Aims of the project: <br>
-> understanding the concepts of object-oriented programming <br>
-> understanding the concept of Inheritance <br>
-> using Interfaces <br>
-> Practicing Class Desing <br>
-> Developing Programming Skills <br>
