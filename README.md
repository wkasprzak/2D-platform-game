# 2D Platform Game

This project was created as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course. It's a platform game developed in Java, consisting of 30 classes organized into packages.

## Concepts Covered

The project covers various object-oriented programming concepts, including:

- Classes and objects
- Access modifiers
- Constructors
- Getters and setters
- Inheritance (e.g., classes Entity and Player)
- Abstract classes (e.g., class Entity, class Enemy)
- Interfaces (e.g., StateMethods)

## Object-Oriented Principles

The project also adheres to object-oriented programming principles, such as:

- Encapsulation (using access modifiers like private and protected)
- Data abstraction (objects provide a simplified, abstract version of their implementations)
- Inheritance (as mentioned in the examples above)
- Polymorphism (e.g., StateMethods interface for states throughout the game)

## Project Objectives

The objectives of the project include:

- Understanding the concepts of object-oriented programming
- Understanding the concept of inheritance
- Using interfaces
- Practicing class design
- Developing programming skills
